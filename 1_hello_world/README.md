# 1_hello_world
### In this exercise, we will connect a SpringBoot APP to an H2 database just to insert 1 registry.
- It is very important to have an H2 database installed, which can be downloaded from the following link:
https://www.h2database.com/html/main.html
    - Very fast, open source, JDBC API
    - Embedded and server modes; in-memory databases
    - Browser based Console application
    - Small footprint: around 2 MB jar file size 
- Execute the code and observe the output in console. Try to find in the messages the actions that are carried out on the database.
